TRICKBOT scenario

initial access via malspam, payload delivery, command and control (C2) communications, lateral movement, credential theft, and persistence.

ANALYSIS:

exercise 3 - trickbot infection

all it took for workstation to be infected was 3 minutes

08:01:12 application outlook - user openned email with “Invoice Attached” -> downloaded invoice.zip to C:\Users\user\Downloads -> extracted to invoice.doc and oppened with macros enabled (runs visual basic where can be embedded script, code or someother malicious content) needs further examination -> base64 encoded script (usually used for obfuscation of malicious code) -> powershell downloads from hxxp://trickbotpayload[.]com/gtag32.exe (looks like C2 server) -> new process created gtag32.exe -> firewall policy changed that allowed outbound connection through TLS 185.225.69.72:443 -> DNS resolved trickbot2[.]net to 185.225.69.72 -> http client posts /guidcheck to malicious Server (this look like some validation that endpoint was succesfully compromised -> after that we have successful GET request for systeminfo.dll file -> systemunfo.dll is run and seems to be disguisted credential dumping tool -> WMI lateral movement from IP=192.168.1.8 (WMI movement means movement through system by network)

connection from 192.168.1.5 using anonymous credentials should raise alarms also but there is not enough data to stop it just by this information

svc_sync newly created user by process winhost.exe (which is malicious makes this user malicious also -> UpdateTask at 02:00 a clock can be legetimate but in this scenario it look more like attacker might be trying to create fake update with root access and push it onto servers to hide his tracks -> curl[2257] posting logs.zip to IP=185.225.69.72 is absolute redflag because this might be exfiltration of data, also this IP is linked to TrickBot even in those logs

08:03:00 attacker seems to be covering tracks and syslog provided us with IP=192.168.1.8 connected to 185.225.69.72 without authorization while at:
08:03:15 we see root access account deleting winhost.exe file from system
08:03:25 failed password from IP=192.168.1.5 using ssh and at:
08:03:40 firewall blocks this IP while also blocking external IP which might be and also is TrickBot C2 server (IP=185.225.69.72)
08:04:00 manual or automated EDR which also catched gtag32.exe as possible signs of malicious
08:04:30 incident is sent to SOC with tag as suspectwd TrickBot infection
