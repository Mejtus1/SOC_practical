ANALYSIS:
sshd6011 - suspicious because of invalid user trying to log in
disgruntled employee ?

apache2[1378] external IP 203.0.113.5 tried to access admin file name - suspicious

06:50:01 mysql[2389] admin ssh from external IP=192.168.1.22

I would by this tome categorize in my head possible intrusion from IPs 192.168.1.— and 203.0.113.— ranges since those 2 and their generics try to access admin or ports
this can totally be normal trafic like others until now but In my opinion it seems suspicious in this short timeframe

06:58:30 firewall[1293] port 80 deny IP=203.0.113.22

07:00:01 ssh[6200] failed password IP=192.168.1.35:22

07:06:10 apache2[1450] IP=203.0.113.7 REQ=password reset

07:08:14 firewall[1301] IP=198.51.100.14:443 deny access

07:10:30 john removed logs -> immediate attention and also try to look back at his behavior
which IP is he connected with ?
look out for other person similar behavior like john, if possible call him if company policy doesnt deny it.
we have log 06:23:12 ssh [6034] accepted password for john from IP=192.168.1.14:22 ssh

I am gonna skip for now unsucessful attempts from mentioned IP ranges and focus on john
I would give it to another analyst to take care of them -> either monitor those ranges or block them

07:22:12 ssh[6260] I would look out for emily’s behavior sice we have state of caution from all those time stretched attack/resource get trying IP=192.168.1.14:22

Overall I dont see any other lateral movement through network or successful access to priviledged assets etc, for sure there is an adversay trying to access resources but that is now job of other analyst to block and take care of while I myself am looking out for john and possibly alice althorugh i dont have any facts based neferious behavior from her.

ANALYSIS:
08:05:20 firewall[1201] external IP 203.0.113.10 trying to connect - suspicious

08:13:12 firewall[1215] allowed acces on port 443 = https for internal IP=192.168.1.15
question arises who’s node it that ?
I corelate it with next SCADA unauthorized system attempt which happened just 20 seconds later
08:15:30 scada[1110]
08:16:05 plc[2005] issues system error for sensor malfunction in Tank4 this requires immediate attention and contact engineer responsible no just on site but also electrionics/software

08:23:50 firewall[1230] port 53 denied acces IP=203.0.113.50 (external) and similar to one trying to access internal systems from the outside, I would suggest regarding the criticality of the situation to assign an analyst if one is free to block all IPs from that range for at least an 3 hour period

08:28:05 scada[1140] unauthorized acces detected this time also from silimae IP=203.0.113.35

08:32:10 vpn[1530] of alice which was logged in not long time before and this time she is trying to access from 203.0.113.30 -> suspicious IP range

08:36:45 scada[1150] irregular valve

08:42:05 firewall[1265] IP=203.0.113.55:80 suspicious Ip range again trying to connect

08:44:00 scada[1170] unauthorozed acess attempt segment 9

ANALYSIS:

facts:
upon closer examination of logs past 10:20:25 which by itself couldn’t be classified as suspicious or mailicous I’ve came to conclusion to classify it as attackers first entry point into server with IP=192.168.1.50:22 as user1
next exact fact is that from same IP=192.168.1.50:22 logged in user2 at 10:40:02

at 10:55:20 server apache2[2002] can be seen as brute force attack aganst the server - its request exceeded 1000/second which is not feasable for human being and this IP should be restricted from accessing our server at least for 3 hours

cannot attribute:
- there is no exact clue that attacker from Ip= 192.168.1.50 is doing these malicious steps on our servers
- it would need more forensic examination so I would immediately send it to L2
- it might be corelated because it is happening at the same time but without proper validation I cannot connect those 2 events together, there might have been attacker in the network before and is now executing those malicious steps or it might also be that attacker is trying to decieve defenders by lounching multiple attacks at once:
1. brute forcing attempts
2. accessing accounts - user1 and user2 while trying lateral movement through network
3. while lounching attack pre-ready from the inside
- this might indicate sophisticated attacker and requires immediate attention

at 10:35:10 we have server root acces removing forcefully with /bin/rm -rf important_folder which should raise flags in analyst

10:38:45 someone issued a get request for admin at server with which server responded with code 500 = internal server error

10:45:10 server kernel issues log on ethernet interface 0 source address 192.168.1.120 allowed 192.168.1.1 to have acess on port 22 (destination and source port)

audit log on server issued at 10:50:01 that looks like deletes file which it fould suspicious = eví_script.sh

my_sql server 10:59:00 denied ssh access to root@192.168.1.100 user, from this behavior I would suggest that it is the same attacker because he seems to operate with different IP addresses and more fronts but with same tactic -> ssh access as initial access

11:02:33
and
11:06:50
- audit server denied access to run evil_script and malware_check denied secret_file.txt
- this requires further investigation about how those files got there

11:13:15 attacker tried to download from https[:]/malicious-site.com/file.exe
5 minutes after that server reports root command of suer issuing execute permissions to important_file with chmod 777 at time: 11:18:20

11:25:30 we have log for evil_file.exe which catched signature of file and reported it as Trojan
